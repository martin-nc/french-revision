# French revision

Contains a couple of quick test pages to help revise which French verbs are used with "à" and which with "de". There are two pages:

 - [Exercise with examples](https://martin-nc.github.io/french-revision/): click on the verb to reveal not only the appropriate preposition ("à" or "de"), but an example sentence.
 - [Exercise without examples](https://martin-nc.github.io/french-revision/a-de-verbs-noexamples.html): click on the verb to reveal just the appropriate preposition.

 This was also an experiment to make a page with zero dependencies: no theme, no CSS library, no Google font, no Javascript framework and no site generator.
